    <h2>Autobiography</h2>
    Currently a BSCS undergrad in UPLB, I am just floating my way through this thing called life. 
    I usually say I have six raisons d'être which are Shoujo☆Kageki Revue Starlight, BanG Dream!, Keyakizaka46, D4DJ, all kinds of sapphic media, and music. 
    My other main interest is playing video games from any genre as long as I find it interesting. 
    I'm currently mainly playing League of Legends: Wild Rift and Free Fire though.

    <h2>Skills</h2>
    + programming and debugging algorithms and applications using PLs such as
    Python, C, Java, and Dart 
    + creating and managing databases using SQL and
    MariaDB
